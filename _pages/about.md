About me
======
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the 
[Department of Computer & Information Sciences at Towson University](https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/computerinfosci/), 
supervised by 
[Prof. Xin Huang](https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/computerinfosci/facultystaff/xin-huang.html). 
I previously received my B.Eng. degree in 
[Artificial Intelligence, School of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Jinan University](https://sisse.jnu.edu.cn/).

My primary research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence, mainly focusing on GeoAI and medical image analysis.
